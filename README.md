### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

> PhD Student @ University of Liverpool's Distributed Algorithms CDT. Researching Bayesian inference & signal processing for underwater acoustic and sonar applications.

I'm a PhD researcher at the **University of Liverpool**, affiliated with the **Centre for Doctoral Training in Distributed Algorithms**. My work is centered at the intersection of state estimation and Bayesian methods to solve complex challenges in underwater acoustic signal processing.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my PhD research in multi-target tracking.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about advanced Bayesian filtering techniques.
